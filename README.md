# 📦 Inventory & Supply Chain Management Analytics — End-to-End SQL + Python + Power BI Project

## 📘 Project Overview

Inventory & Supply Chain Management Analytics is a complete end-to-end data analytics solution designed to monitor operational efficiency, optimize inventory levels, reduce logistics costs, and improve fulfillment performance.This project demonstrates the full analytics lifecycle — from raw structured data extraction using SQL, to advanced exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Python, and finally executive-level KPI reporting using Power BI with dynamic measures.

The dashboard enables data-driven operational decisions by analyzing:

Warehouse utilization

Inventory turnover & holding efficiency

Transportation cost distribution

Lead time optimization

Backorder trends

Regional & category-level inventory performance

---
🎯 Objective:

Analyze inventory efficiency and stock movement

1)Identify high transportation cost regions and categories

2)Optimize warehouse utilization

3)Reduce backorders and fulfillment delays

4)Support data-driven supply chain decision-making
